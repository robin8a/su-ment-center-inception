WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackboard Inc. today announced that it will rebrand its SaaS open-source learning management system formerly known as Moodlerooms as "Blackboard Open LMS." In conjunction with this change, the company is accelerating investment and development of the product.

The rebrand follows Blackboard's strategic decision to exit the Moodle Certified Partner Program. Blackboard remains committed to providing clients with the most mature and stable Moodle-based Software as a Service (SaaS) product in the market and will continue to support the Moodle project. The decision to exit the partner program allows Blackboard to focus its resources on continued development of the Blackboard Open LMS platform.
